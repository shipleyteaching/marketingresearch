    "text": "There are two opportunities for the extra credit that are offered during the course. For each one that you complete, I will add a percentage point to your final grade. Because these opportunities exist, I do not round grades. Extra credit assignments are due when you turn in your project.\n\n\nInterview someone involved in marketing research (Account Executive, Data Analyst, Research Assistant/Associate, etc.) to understand more about their job and write a 1-page summary of the interview (bullet points are fine). Interviews should only last 10-15 minutes so you don’t take up too much of the person’s time (worth 1 point on your final average). Interview questions suggestions:\na. Asking the individual to walk you through a day from morning until afternoon\nb. Asking them what the best and worst things about their job are\nc. How they got into the field\nd. The most important skills/personality characteristics required for the job\ne. How someone interested in this career might best go about breaking into the field\nf. Any other questions you think are interesting\n\n\n\nFind a current example in the popular press (or video, movie, etc) of a topic we are talking about in class. You will need to detail the example and clearly illustrate how it relates to marketing research and a specific topic discussed in class in a 1-page write-up (provide links to videos, products, or ads if needed). Topics need to be approved by me first as no duplicates will be allowed (worth 1 point on your final average)."

    "text": "TODO: add example/content from Zinser\nOne of my goals for this course is to help you develop your research writing. Specifically, I would like you to gain some experience writing with an objective and impartial tone. Tone refers to the author’s attitude toward the topic they are writing about, which can be evident by the author’s word choice. Take a look at the two passages below.\n\nThe objective tone is impartial. It doesn’t show positive or negative feelings toward the topic being written. Additionally, it avoids the use of 1st and 2nd person pronouns.\nThe subjective tone is personal, emotional, and typically informal.\n\nThe following examples will hopefully help differentiate the two.\n\nThis place may be shabby, but since my children were born while we lived here, it has a special place in my heart.\n\nThe tone is sentimental. “It has a special place in my heart,” expresses tender emotions.\n\nThis isn’t the best apartment in the world, but it’s not that bad.\n\nThe tone is tolerant. The words “not that bad” suggest that the writer accepts the situation while recognizing it could be better.\n\nIf only decent jobs were out there, I wouldn’t be reduced to living in this miserable dump.\n\nThe tone is bitter. The writer presents a situation that forces them to live in a “miserable dump.”\n\nThis place does need some repairs, but I’m sure the landlord will be making improvements sometime soon.\n\nThe tone is optimistic. The writer is expecting the apartment to be improved soon.\n\nWhen we move away, we’re planning to release three hundred cockroaches and two mice, so we can leave the place exactly as we found it.\n\nThe tone is humorous. The writer claims to be planning comic revenge on the landlord by returning the apartment to the terrible condition when the tenants moved in.\n\nThis is the apartment we live in. It provides shelter.\n\nThe tone is objective. The writer does not express feelings about the apartment and only states factual information."

    "text": "The purpose of an interview is to understand better why someone made a decision, thought something, made a purchase, etc. You want the person you are interviewing to share their rationale for a decision or thoughts/opinions openly and honestly, so make sure the questions you ask allow them to do so. Whatever you are interested in, make sure the questions emphasize that you are interested in their thoughts, opinions, or rationale. And remember, this is not the survey portion, the questions do not need to be so specific that you could quantify anything.\nSo, what kind of questions should I ask? It’ll depend on what you want to know, but generally speaking, the following couple of phrases may be helpful starting points.\n\nWhat about X made you interested in purchasing it?\nHow was your experience buying X?\nCan you describe the last time you bought X?\nWhat do you think about X?\nHow would you describe your experience with X?\nHow did you find out about X?\nHow do you think X could go about fixing Y?\nWhat process did you go through to make your decision to buy X?"

    "text": "Assignment 2 is split into 4 sections with several sub-sections.\nThe purpose of assignment 2 is to effectively (1) design a survey and collect data, (2) analyze the data, (3) reflect on possible limitations of the research, and (4) provide some key takeaways that could provide your company some strategic advantages.\n\n\nThe survey you design will depend on the research objectives you have defined earlier in the class. The goal here is to write survey questions that will accurately measure whatever is pertinent to your research objective.\n\n\n\n\nQualtrics is a survey-building website. The university also provides access to this. You can log in via the university at the qualtrics log-inlog-in page.\n\n\n\nProlific is a website that handles the participant recruitment for the surveys that will be made in class. Unfortunately, this is not free. The following lays out what we’ll do with Prolific.\n\nNot everyone needs to create a prolific account. Decide who in the group will sign-up for the prolific account. Whoever does will be responsible for fronting the money for the rest of the group, though.\nCreate a new survey and fill out the “Study Details” section.\nUnder “Study Link” paste the Qualtrics survey URL (this is only available after publishing the survey) and mark the “I don’t need to record these” option.\nUnder “Study Completion” check the “I’ll redirect them using a URL” option.\n\nThis should generate a unique URL for your survey. Copy this URL to your clipboard and go back to Qualtrics.\nGo to the end of your survey, there should be an “End of Survey” block, if there isn’t get my attention. If there is, click it and along the left side there should be a drop-down box for the end of the survey message. Select “Redirect to URL” and paste the URL into the box.\nMake sure that it works by going through the preview of your survey and going all the way to the end. If everything works, go back to Prolific.\n\nUnder the “Audience” tab, select “everyone.” This way is the cheapest.\nDetermine how many people you will survey based on the group’s budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDon’t make an account until after we discuss it in class. I’m still considering doing this portion for the class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey design section of Assignment 2 should be detailed enough that someone else could replicate your study. It should be approx. 2-4 pages with the following sub-sections.\n\n\nThis is where you can provide details regarding the collection procedures, software used, etc.\n\n\n\nWalk your reader through the survey, giving a rough idea of the flow of the survey and some of the questions that were asked. Please include the entire survey in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nExport the survey from Qualtrics into a Word Document\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery part of research is a decision, including the sample. Make sure to answer the following:\n\nWhat was the population you are generalizing to?\nWhat type of sampling was used?\nHow many subjects completed the survey?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter having collected data from your survey, you will have to analyze it. This section details what I expect of your analyses and provides links to the tools and resources that’ll be most relevant at this stage.\n\n\n\n\nSPSS will be used to analyze the data after it’s been collected; however, if you feel more comfortable using R or Python, I am willing to be flexible about which software is used. If you find yourself confused with anything in SPSS, I am of course happy to help, but Research By Design is a solid source for SPSS tutorials. The version of SPSS is a little older than what you’d be using, but the instructions should be roughly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUTK provides this for its students, so don’t pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should include the demographic information of the sample and sample-related descriptive statistics.\n\n\n\nThis potion should be split into sub-sections, one for each research objective. Aim for about a page per research object and make sure to include the following:\n\nA review of what question(s) were asked in the survey\nThe results of the analyses\n\n\n\n\n\nAll research is flawed, and the only way to effectively improve at anything is to be aware that you made mistakes. This section should be used to demonstrate that you are aware of the flaws in your research. It should be a minimum of 2 pages addressing anything that may have influenced the study results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLimitations that are tied directly back to the lecture, make me happy while grading, which tends to have spillover effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conclusions and recommendations are where you’ll explain what your analyses mean and put them back into the context of your introduction. So if in your introduction/assignment 1, you decided to explore research objective X because of a societal trend, then explain what you found and how it makes sense with what you already knew from the introduction research. Additionally, provide some recommendations for the company of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDo not include more statistics in this section."

For example, suppose you learn that customer service is problematic based on secondary data. In that case, you can ask questions about customer service in the interviews to help you identify when customer service is lacking (weekends, busy hours, etc.). The discussions should help you see real customers’ perceptions of your company/product (strengths and weaknesses).

Assignments are considered late if not turned in by the beginning of class.\n\nGroup Project\nThe group project is due on the last day of the semester by midnight. This is when the canvas course locks you out, so you will not be able to turn anything in late. Included in the course calendar are many “checkpoints” to ensure that your group is on track. Use the checkpoints as a guide for finishing the project on time.\nIt should be noted that, although the grade for the group project is shared (i.e., everyone in the group will receive the same grade), this can be changed if I believe group members are not pulling their weight. Additionally, a group can put a group member on probation if that member has missed more than 2 classes. Excused absences do not count toward this. If the group member continues to be problematic, the group can “fire” that member. Students who are “fired” from their group will be responsible for completing the group project on their own. If the group is considering firing a member of their group, you must receive my explicit permission to do so, lest the group project descends into anarchy.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two exams. My objective with these exams will be to test how well you understand the concepts I have taught during the lectures/assigned in the text. In general, my goal is to help you develop better critical thinking skills. Thus, the exams are designed to make you apply the covered concepts.\nExams will be comprised of multiple-choice and True/False questions. No make-up exams will be scheduled for any reason other than a well-documented medical release signed by a physician or some emergency. If you have to miss any scheduled exam, you must notify me prior to your absence in order to make arrangements for a makeup. If you miss an exam without notifying me or without the documentation mentioned above, you will receive a zero for that test.\nExams will be administered through Canvas using Respondus Lockdown Browser with Monitor. This means you will need to have a laptop computer with a working microphone and webcam. You will have a 12-hour window (8 am to 8 pm) to take exams on your assigned day. You will have 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete exams. The exams will shut down at 8 pm so please be sure to start them by 6:30 pm."

Check the emergency posters near exits and elevators for building-specific information. In the event of an emergency, the course schedule and assignments may be subject to change. If changes to graded activities are required, reasonable adjustments will be made, and you will be responsible for meeting revised deadlines.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nEach student is responsible for their integrity in academic life and for adhering to UT’s Honor Statement. The Honor Statement reads: “An essential feature of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is a commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and academic honesty. As a student at the university, I pledge that I will neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and integrity.”\n\n\nYour Role in Improving the Course Through Assessment\nAt UT, it is our collective responsibility to improve the state of teaching and learning. During the semester you may be requested to assess aspects of this course either during class or after the class. You are encouraged to respond to these various forms of assessment as a means of continuing to improve the quality of the UT learning experience.\n\n\nDisability Statement\nAny student who feels they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact Student Disabilities Services in Dunford Hall, at 865-974-6087, or by video relay at, 865-622-6566, to coordinate reasonable academic accommodations.\n\n\nAccessibility Policy and Training\nMore information can be found at http://accessibility.utk.edu\n\n\nWellness\nThe Student Counseling Center is the university’s primary facility for personal counseling, psychotherapy, and psychological outreach and consultation services.\nThe Center for Health Education and Wellness manages 974-HELP, the distressed student protocol, case management, the Sexual Assault Response Team, and the Threat Assessment Task Force.\n\n\nSocial Distancing & Covid-19 Procedures\nStudents are required to wear face masks at all times and maintain social distance (6 feet between individuals in traditional classrooms, or, in instructional laboratories and similar settings, only a few minutes in closer proximity when necessary to achieve learning objectives). Students who are feeling ill or experiencing symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or a higher than normal temperature will be excused from class and should stay at home.\nInstructors have the right to ask those who are not complying with these requirements to leave class in the interest of everyone’s health and safety. If a student refuses to comply with these requirements, the instructor has the right to cancel a class.\nAdditionally, following other simple practices will promote good health in and out of the classroom, such as frequent and thorough hand washing, wiping down desks and seats with disinfectant wipes whenever possible, not sharing personal items such as pens and cell phones, and avoiding crowded hallways and other enclosed spaces.\nThe Volunteer Creed reminds us that we bear the torch in order to give light to others. As Volunteers, we commit to caring for one another and for the members of the communities in which we live, work, and learn. This semester, the University asks that we all demonstrate the Volunteer spirit by following these and other health guidelines and requirements."
